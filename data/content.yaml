  content_header:
    "The Earth is facing one of the most pressing global challenges of the 21st century: 
    The rise in global surface temperatures.
    This phenomenon, which is due to climate change, has reached alarming proportions in recent decades 
    and is having far-reaching environmental, social and economic consequences.
    The scientific community has repeatedly stated that average global temperatures are rising, 
    and the evidence is overwhelming. This rise is primarily due to the increased release of 
    greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N₂O) due to 
    human activities.
    
    The purpose of this dashboard is to give you the opportunity to take a closer look at NASA's surface 
    temperature anomaly data and Our World In Data's CO₂ emissions data using interactive graphics."

  content_description:
    "The GISS Surface Temperature Analysis Version 4 (GISTEMP v4), as shown here, is an estimate of global surface 
    temperature change from monthly mean values. The anomalies are based on NOAA GHCN v4 (Global Historical Climatology 
    Network Version 4) and ERSST v5 (Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature Version 5) data."

  figure_description:
    "With reference to the most recent data, it is clear from the map that the Earth is warming up strongly. 
    Almost exclusively, higher temperature values have been measured."

    It becomes visible that the outer areas are reached more and more often as time progresses.
    In other words: The world heats up!"

    shown on the left - namely, that average temperatures are rising steadily."

    'CAUSES OF TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES: CO₂ EMISSIONS'

  content_01:
    "As has been scientifically proven and advocated for decades, warming is due to increased emissions of greenhouse 
    gases by humans. Each country's contribution to global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise from its cumulative 
    emissions of carbon dioxide. The warming effects of each gas are calculated based on cumulative CO₂-equivalent 
    emissions using the Global Warming Potential (GWP*) approach."

  content_02:
    "Besides the world map, a so-called treemap visualization is also available. It gives you the possibility to 
    divide the countries into predefined groups for better comparison. World regions or the division of countries 
    into income groups are possible options here."

  content_03:
    "It becomes clear that for many African countries there are no data on the shares in the global temperature 
    increase due to the CO₂ emissions produced. In contrast, however, the graph shows that the USA is by far 
    the largest contributor. "

  content_01:
    "In order to reduce the man-made global temperature increase, international agreements were drawn up as early 
    as 1997 in Kyoto and 2015 in Paris, which had and have the goal of limiting the global average temperature increase 
    to 1.5°C by reducing CO₂ emissions. The development of CO₂ consumption per capita (right) and overall (left) is 
    shown below."

  content_02:
    "It is also possible to change the preset grouping here."

  content_03:
    "Furthermore, the right graph visually highlights the prediction that CO₂ consumption per capita may only be 1.5 
    tons from 2022 onwards in order to have a realistic chance of meeting the targets."
